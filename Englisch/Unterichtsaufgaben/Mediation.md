There are different kinds of Autonomous vehicles from Level 0 to 5

At Level 0 there is no kind of support or automation in the vehicle what so ever

At Level 1 the vehicle is equipped with different Systems that can assist the human operator when turned on by them, but may be overtaken at any moment.

At level 2 The vehicle can mostly drive maneuvers without assistance of the driver, but needs constant supervision by the driver so he can overrule the car in difficult situations

At level 3 the vehicle can drive for certain lengths entirely on its own but may request to driver to step in at difficult situations

At level 4 the vehicle is able to make the whole drive on its own turning the driver into a passenger. In difficult Situation the vehicle is able to safely get the vehicle out of traffic on its own

At level 5 the vehicle is a master at driving and is in no need of a human driver whatsoever.
Whole drives are completely and without problem done by the Vehicle itself.
